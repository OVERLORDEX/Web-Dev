    "#Using the browser developer tools\n",
    "\n",
    "Web development is tricky. That's why web developers use lots of tools to help them with their jobs—and they're always looking for new tools to add to their toolbox.\n",
    "The browser developer tools which are included in most modern browsers are a big favorite of most developers. Each browser differs in exactly which tools they provide, but they're more similar than they are different.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inspecting HTML\n",
    "One great tool is the ability to right click on any element on a webpage and inspect the HTML for that element. Here's a video of how to do that in Chrome:\n",
    "\n",
    "Inspecting CSS\n",
    "Another useful tool is the CSS inspector; with this tool, you can check out which styles gets applied to an element and play with them yourself. Here's a video showing how to use this tool in Chrome:\n",
    "\n",
    "These tools can both help you understand the structure of other websites and help you debug your own websites.\n",
    "There are lots more tools as well, but those two will give you a great start to being a better web developer. Try inspecting an element on this webpage and see what you find out"

    "#Developing webpages outside of Khan Academy\n",
    "\n",
    "We provide an in-browser coding editor for you here on Khan Academy to make it easy for you to try out HTML, get immediate feedback, and share your work.\n",
    "However, our coding editor doesn't let you try everything—both for security reasons and because it's hard to host a full-featured editor in such a small space!\n",
    "Once you learn HTML/CSS here, you will likely want to start developing webpages in a more full-featured editor outside of Khan Academy, which would add features like multiple files, file search, and custom plugins. In any editor that you use, make sure you save your file with a filename that ends in \".html\"— that's the file extension that is used for all HTML pages to make sure that both editors and browsers know what they are.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Online editors\n",
    "\n",
    "One option is to use an online editor, similar to ours but with additional features. You might want to use an online editor if you have a computer that doesn't let you download apps or you want to use the same editor across multiple computers. Popular online editors are JSBin, Repl.it, Glitch, and CodePen. If you're on a ChromeBook, you can install a Chrome web app like Caret or Zed. Here's a video of me editing a webpage in Cloud9:\n",
    "\n",
    "#Desktop editors\n",
    "\n",
    "Another option is to use a desktop editor. An app is downloaded to your computer and saves the files to your hard drive. There are lots of desktop editors for you to pick from, depending on what OS and price you're looking for. Some popular desktop editors are Visual Studio Code, Atom, Sublime Text, Adobe Brackets, and Notepad++ (for Windows). Here's a video of me editing a webpage in Sublime Text:\n",
    "\n",
    "#Command-line editors\n",
    "\n",
    "A third option is to use a command-line editor. If you're not already familiar with the command line, you probably don't want to go down this route since you'll also need to learn a lot about the command line first. On the other hand, if you love typing and navigating with your keyboard instead of your mouse, you might find you love command-line tools. Two popular command-line editors are Emacs and Vim, and they are often already installed on Unix-based systems like Macs and Linux. Here's a video of me editing a webpage in Vim:\n",
    "\n",
    "#Picking an editor\n",
    "\n",
    "Which one should you pick? Well, you're welcome to just keep using the Khan Academy HTML/CSS editor for now. Eventually though, you'll want to get comfortable with at least one other editor. You might want to try out a couple different free options and see which one you like the most. You can also ask around to see what friends and colleagues use. It's often helpful to use whichever tool is most popular with your peers because then you can ask them for help.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, here's a graph of what my Khan Academy colleagues use. Some of them don't write HTML/CSS, so their favorite editor might not be a good choice for you.\n",

    "#Hosting your website on a server\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article, I'll walk you through one way that you can take your webpage and host it on your own server.\n",
    "Why would you want that? And what's a \"server\" anyway?\n",
    "When you visit websites on the internet, they are each hosted by a \"server\". A server is a computer located somewhere in the world that's connected to the internet, and that computer's job is to \"serve\" webpages to internet users that want to view them\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create webpages here on Khan Academy, it's the Khan Academy servers that are in charge of serving your webpages. That's nice of us, since you can share your webpages with friends for free, but there are some disadvantages: 1) your webpages have a bunch of Khan Academy user interface surrounding them, 2) your webpage has \"khanacademy.org\" in the URL, and 3) you can only create single webpages, not multi-file websites.\n",
    "All of that is great when your goal is learning, but not ideal if your goal is to create a professional looking website, like a portfolio, resume, or shop.\n",
    "When you develop webpages on your own computer, then you can create multi-file websites that aren't surrounded by Khan Academy UI - but the URL of your site looks like \"http://localhost\" or \"file://...\".\n",
    "If you try sharing a URL like that with a friend and they try loading it on their computer, they'll be sad because they won't be able to see your website! Those URLs are \"local\" URLs, only viewable on your own computer.\n",
    "So now you need a server to \"host\" your webpages, and that's where you have a lot of options. Many companies are \"hosts\" or \"hosting providers\", and they make money by letting people host your webpage files on their servers.\n",
    "You might also want your own domain name - like \"khanacademy.org\" or \"yourownname.com\". You can buy those from a \"domain name registrar\", pay a small amount each year to keep them around, and then point that domain to your server. You can also learn more about domains, from the inventor of the internet himself!\n",
    "\n",
    "You can search the internet for \"hosting providers\" and \"domain name registrars\" if you want to check out all the companies offering those services and see what their pricing is like.\n",
    "Since this is Khan Academy, where we like to enable you to learn skills for free, I'm going to show you an option for hosting your website for free on a place called Github."

    "#Hosting your website on Github\n",
    "\n",
    "Github is a company that hosts \"code repositories\", collections of code for projects. Many of the code repositories are \"open source\", which means they're publicly available for the whole world to browse. That's awesome, because that's how programmers learn from each other and build on each other's work! Khan Academy has quite a few open source repositories. Code repositories can contain all sorts of types of code, not just HTML and CSS - whatever code is needed to make the project work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why am I telling you about them? Well, Github has a feature called Github Pages, which makes it easy and free for you to create a multi-file website hosted at yourusername.github.io.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Khan Academy is not affiliated with Github. Please consult the Github Terms of Use and other policies before deciding to sign up for an account, especially if you are under 13 years of age.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Sign up for a Github account\n",
    "\n",
    "Visit github.com, and you'll see a signup form on their front page. (If you don't, congrats, you already have an account! You can skip to Step 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "When you're picking up your username, keep in mind that it will be publicly viewable on the internet and it will be in the URL of your website: yourusername.github.io. Some people like to use nicknames or funny names instead of their real name, for privacy reasons, but that's up to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "On Step 2, choose the free plan. You don't need a paid plan for a public website repository. (You can always upgrade later if you become a prolific Github user and need their professional features.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "On Step 3, you can answer the survey questions or skip that step:\n",

    "After you fill out the new account form, make sure you check your email inbox and click the link to verify your email address:\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a Github project for your website\n",
    "Once you verify your email address, you'll see the start page. Click \"Start a project\".\n",
    "\n",
    "On the project creation page, you'll be asked for a project name. Make sure to name your project exactly “YOUR_USERNAME.github.io”. That tells Github that you’re making a special webpage project, so that it knows to upload your files to that user-facing URL whenever you change them. Since my username was \"PamelaFoxBot\", I named my project \"PamelaFoxBot.github.io\":\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations, you have a new project! But it has no files yet. As a quick way to create the first file, click the \"README\" link:\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you're looking at the Github file editor interface, for a file named README.md. Change the filename from README.md to index.html. Servers expect index.html to be the name of the main file of a website folder. Your index can then link to other pages of the website.\n",
    "\n",
    "Delete the current contents of the file editor and replace them with the HTML of your webpage. You can copy and paste the HTML from a project from Khan Academy or one you've been developing on your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Scroll down the page until you find the Commit area, and click “Commit new file”. Every time you create a new version of a file, you are making a “commit” to record that in the file version history. Each commit has a message to describe the change. Github suggests a default message (“Create index.html”, in this case), but you can override that by typing in the box.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type YOUR_USERNAME.github.io in the browser, and reload until your webpage appears.\n",
    "\n",
    "Github takes from 1-10 minutes to upload your project changes to the user-facing webpage URL, so you may need to exercise patience. You may also need to \"hard reload\" (hold shift while reloading), to clear the browser cache.\n",
    "\n",
    "Upload multi-file websites to Github\n",
    "Some of you may already be working on multi-file websites outside of Khan Academy, using a desktop editor. Your website might have multiple HTML, CSS, JS, and image files.\n",
    "If you want to upload that website to Github, don't worry, you don't need to copy and paste each of those files individually! That would get quite tedious indeed. There's a better way...\n",
    "Open your project on Github and click \"Upload files\".\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll see the Github file uploader interface. To select your files, drag-and-drop or use the file chooser:"
