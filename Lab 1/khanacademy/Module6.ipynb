    "            <p>The <strong>ocean</strong> is the connected body of salty water that covers 70.8% of the Earth's surface. The sea moderates the Earth's climate and has important roles in the water cycle, carbon cycle, and nitrogen cycle. Although the sea has been travelled and explored since prehistory, the modern scientific study of the sea—oceanography—dates broadly to the British Challenger expedition of the 1870s. The sea is conventionally divided into four or five large sections, such as the Pacific, called oceans while smaller sections, such as the Mediterranean, are known as seas.\n",

    "    Owing to the present state of continental drift, the Northern Hemisphere is now fairly equally divided between land and sea (a ratio of about 2:3) but the South is overwhelmingly oceanic (1:4.7). Salinity in the open ocean is generally in a narrow band around 3.5% by mass, although this can vary in more landlocked waters, near the mouths of large rivers, or at great depths. About 85% of the solids in the open sea are sodium and chloride. Deep-sea currents are produced by differences in salinity and temperature. Surface currents are formed by the friction of waves produced by the wind and by tides, the changes in local sea level produced by the gravity of the Moon and Sun. The direction of all of these is governed by surface and submarine land masses and by the rotation of the Earth (the Coriolis effect).\n",

    "\n",
    "That's not always the best strategy, however, as it can lead to a lot of wasted time writing HTML and CSS that you later discard. Instead, you should plan your webpage before you actually build it. You can figure out content, layout, and even the look and feel.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Brainstorming\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step of planning anything is often brainstorming—figuring out anything and everything you might want to do. You brainstorm by drawing mind maps on paper, jotting notes in a document, or by putting post-it notes on a board.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can brainstorm by yourself or—if you want to multiply the range of ideas—enlist a collaborator to brainstorm with you. While you're brainstorming with a collaborator, use the \"Yes, and…\" approach. Don't focus on what won't work about your collaborator's ideas; focus on what might work and which related things might work.\n",
    "\n",

    "This wireframe was created in a popular online prototyping tool called Balsamiq. You can also make wireframes using the shape tools in office tool—like Powerpoint/Keynote—or by using design apps like Photoshop, Gimp, or InDesign. You can also search for more prototyping tools online. Keep in mind that many wireframing apps cost money when you're deciding which to use.\n",
